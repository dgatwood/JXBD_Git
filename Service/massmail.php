$message="<h2>Jaxboards Updates!</h2><br />
<p>JaxBoards is finally nearing the end of the beta stage, and we'd like to thank all of you who have supported us this far.</p>
<p>There were quite a few of you who simply registered a forum and never did anything with it! Which makes us kind of sad. However, there's good news! We've been continuously updating the software over the course of 4 months now, and we are now entering the advertising phase. With the advent of per-forum moderators coming out tomorrow, We'll go ahead and push out those updates, and put more work into getting our name out there.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all of those who have worked hard with our developers to knock out any kinks and bugs within the software. Jaxboards relies on your continued support. If you like what we're doing, please let us know! If there's anything you'd like to see, let us know about that, too! Since we're a small service, your voice carries quite far.</p>
